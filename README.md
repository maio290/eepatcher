# EEpatcher (Empire Earth® Patcher)
A small convenience tool to make GOG's Empire Earth® installation mutliplayer ready.

## Why?
The GOG release of Empire Earth requires the `CDKeyCheck` variable in the file `WONLobby.cfg` to be set to `false`. 
This tool is really just an automation for this step, you don't have to use it at all. I only wrote it in order to make playing with some mates a bit easier and so I don't forget what values I need.

## What does it do?
It patches the file `WONLobby.cfg` to a preset which works completely fine with OpenVPN connections.

## How to use?
Just run the release file or compile it yourself. For default paths, everything should work out of the box.

## Misc
Empire Earth is a registred trademark of Rebellion Developments Limited.
